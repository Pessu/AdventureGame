Files are precompiled for every submission so no need to compile this, comes with an exe

HOW TO COMPILE IF NEEDED:
1. Compile the .o files "g++ *.cpp -c"
4. Compile the program the exe "g++ -o adventure.exe *.o"

Module 3 changes:
- Removed goldlib since I had to rework the gold files which were in the library to begin with
- Added an overloaded addition operator for Gold class (used in GoldFactory)
- Added friend class Dungeon for Room class.

Module 2 changes:
- Moved all files into same folder for the repository, less trouble compiling (I use a bit more
complicated folder layout in my IDE.
- Added Load & SaveCommand classes for handling respective commands (save & load)
- Added Utilities class for common tool functions and file handling
- Added a generic "file not found" exception in globals which calls an runtime error
